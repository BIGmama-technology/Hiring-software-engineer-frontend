#  Software engineer frontend test

The principal objective of this project is to evaluate the applicant's ability to learn new skills on the fly, build apealing user interfaces in adherence to best practices and colaborate with peer programers.

This project is about developing a frontend of a web application that allows non-technical users to interact with the HuggingFace Summarization Inference API. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for users to input text, choose model parameters, and request summarization predictions. The goal is to create an intuitive and visually appealing frontend for this API.

## How does this work ?

Below is a list of tasks that candidates concurently work on. If you deem your contribution to be complete, you can create a pull request. 
The team will review your contribution and provide feedback. If its good your branch will be merged with the `main` branch.
Tasks that are done will be ommited and new tasks will apear for others.
Candidates with merged changes will be invited to pass an interview with the team.

## Who can apply ?

Both students looking for an internship at BIGmama and professionals looking for a full-time position can apply.

## Tasks

- Create a React/NextJS project for the Summarization Interface.
- Design and implement a user-friendly form that allows users to input text.
- Include options for users to select model parameters (e.g., summarization ratio, maximum length).
- Implement a button to trigger the request to the HuggingFace API.
- Integrate the HuggingFace Summarization Inference API into your frontend application.
- Make asynchronous API requests to the HuggingFace API when users submit their input.
- Display the summarization result from the API in a visually appealing format.
- Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and provides clear instructions on how to use the application.
- Make the application responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Implement error handling to provide meaningful feedback for issues with user input or API requests.
- Display clear error messages to the user in case of problems.
- Implement client-side caching to save previously requested summaries for quick retrieval.
- Allow users to switch between different summarization models if available in the HuggingFace API.
- Add the option to summarize multiple paragraphs or documents.
- Implement a dark mode or customizable themes.
