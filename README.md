##  Frontend engineer test : HuggingFace Summarization Frontend Interface

**Project Overview**:
You are tasked with developing the frontend of a web application that allows non-technical users to interact with the HuggingFace Summarization Inference API. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for users to input text, choose model parameters, and request summarization predictions. The goal is to create an intuitive and visually appealing frontend for this API.

**Technology Stack**:

Frontend: React/NextJS (or a frontend framework of your choice)
No backend development is required for this test.
Use the HuggingFace Summarization Inference API for text summarization.

**Tasks**:

**Frontend Development**:

Create a React/NextJS (or your preferred frontend framework) project for the Summarization Interface.
Design and implement a user-friendly form that allows users to input text.
Include options for users to select model parameters (e.g., summarization ratio, maximum length).
Implement a button to trigger the request to the HuggingFace API.
API Integration:

Integrate the HuggingFace Summarization Inference API into your frontend application.
Make asynchronous API requests to the HuggingFace API when users submit their input.
Display the summarization result from the API in a visually appealing format.

**User Experience**:

Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and provides clear instructions on how to use the application.
Make the application responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Error Handling**:

Implement error handling to provide meaningful feedback for issues with user input or API requests.
Display clear error messages to the user in case of problems.

**Optional Enhancements (Highly Appreciated)**:

Implement client-side caching to save previously requested summaries for quick retrieval.
Allow users to switch between different summarization models if available in the HuggingFace API.
Add the option to summarize multiple paragraphs or documents.
Implement a dark mode or customizable themes.

**Evaluation Criteria**:

**_Functionality_**: Does the Summarization Interface correctly interact with the HuggingFace API to provide summarization results?

**_User Interface_**: Is the user interface well-designed, user-friendly, and responsive on various devices?

**_Code Quality_**: Is the code well-organized, modular, and follows best practices for frontend development?

**_Error Handling_**: Does the application provide meaningful feedback for user errors and handle issues during API requests?

**_Optional Enhancements_**: Are any optional features or enhancements (caching, model selection, dark mode) implemented effectively?
